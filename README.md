### **1. GENERAL-DESCRIPTION**

#### **What is this list trying to offer ?**

This modlist aims to be a resource for modders with at least enough of an experience in skyrim modding in general, to be able to
trouble shoot their own modlists with the documentation provided for the mods in their descriptions, preexisting guides on the
matter of modding and the tools provided by the modding community and their documentations.
Or people who just want a vanilla experience with all the unofficial patches and fixes.
One resource I highly recommend is [this Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/wiki/begin2) on how to get started.

This modlist is intended to bring the most common tools and fixes for skyrim and integrate them in an Organized maner so modlist creators
and modders have an easier way of getting a stable initial semivanilla setup with only a little effort.
Some of the mods might want to be exchanged by personal preference, "ASLAL" which is included since it is again general consens,
that it is a better to have an alternate start mod that places the player in a "quiet" game cell to let all the installed mods finish their
initial loading and giving the player the time to set up the installed mods MCM Menus to their liking, could be replaced with another alternate start mod.
And I chose "ASLAL" over another "AS" since it still allows you/players playing your modlist a chance to experience the Vanilla start to the game.
**Therefore feel free to use this as a basis for your modlists(but if you do so please mention it somewhere visible).**

### 2. INSTALLATION

0. First for Skyrim itself follow this [Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/wiki/begin2) Starting with the Foreword and ending with the end of the Install Location section.(If you want to be prepared to add mods yourself I highly recommend reading the whole thing.)
1. Install the list with the install from file using the latest [Wabbajack](https://www.wabbajack.org) version.
2. Go to your Skyrim Special Edition root directory. This is the same folder where SkyrimSE.exe is, depending on where you installed it following step **0.** (~~usually \"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition\\"~~ 
If you didn't follow the Guide which I highly advise against.) In there rename the `binkw64.dll` to `binkw64_.dll`.
3. Open the Install Folder (MO2 folder), there navigate to Gamefolder Files.
4. Now put the Content of "Game Folder Files" into your Game Folder.
5. Locate the BethINI.exe in "...\\(name of the MO 2 folder)\tools\BethINI (ONLY LAUNCH WITH MO AND THE GAME CLOSED)" and run it with the game and MO2 closed.
6. In there go to the Setup tab and point BethINI to your ModOrganizer.EXE.
7. Select the SME(FT) Profile you intend to use in the INI Path section.
8. Now you Select a Preset fitting your Hardware/Plans of adding an ENB
9. Save and Exit
10. Open ModOrganizer and select the profile you want to use as your basis
11. Click here ![(restore backup)](https://github.com/EzioTheDeadPoet/SME-FT-/raw/master/backup.png) And restore the lastest backup made by me for every Profile you may be using. (For both the Plugins and the Mods Tab.) **(This is currently NOT needed anymore since Wabbajack does the order now automatically, but I will still support this option just in case something regarding this option might break in the future.)** This is to have the list sorted in the way it was intended by me while writing my guide.
12. Either run the FNIS tool or Nemesis as if you had just installed them (if you selected one of those profiles)
13. To Launch the game select SKSE in MO2 and hit launch, there you can also create MO2 shortcuts to automatically launch linked binaries trough MO2.
14. Your MO2 Setup is now ready to start modding/ playing the most barebone PC friendly Skyrim experience.
15. When adding Mods look out for possible incompatibilities and the [Patches](https://github.com/EzioTheDeadPoet/SME-FT-/blob/master/README.md#3-included-patches) section below.

**Don't try to play the `SME(FT) - Installation` Profile since it is a dummy profile, to keep disabled mods in the right oder in all the profiles.**

---

### 3. Included Patches

If a mod I used has patches for other mods they are included but need to be enabled by you they are marked
by being placed under the `INCLUDED PATCHES` separator and are part of the patch mod category of MO.
Each one of them has the mods the patch is for included in its name and/or a note inside of MO.
If a mod has a patch instead of merging it manually I would advise to check the modpage if there isn't a merged patch
already.

---

### 4. Notes

1. If you want to use Creation Club mods you have to diasable `ReCleaned Menu - If you want to use Creation Club mods disable this!!` in your MO for the option to even be available in the main menu, but since there are more people that don't install mods from there anyway I included this to make their menus cleaner.
2. If you want to use [Blood on the Ice Redux SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6126) you have to right-click `Finding Susanna Alive` and click on reinstall to let it install with the included patch.
