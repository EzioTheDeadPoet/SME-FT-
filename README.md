### 1. GENERAL-DESCRIPTION

This modlist aims to be a resource for modders with at least enough of an experience in skyrim modding in general, to be able to 
trouble shoot your own modlists mith the documentation provided for the mods in their descriptions, preexisting guides on the
matter of modding and the tools provided by the modding community and their documentation.
Or people who want a bareable vanilla experience with all the unofficial patches and fixes.

This resoucre is intended to bring the most common tools and fixes for skyrim and integrate them in an Organized maner so modlist creators
and modders have an easier way of getting a stable initial semivanilla setup with only a little effort.
Some of the mods might want to be exchanged by personal preference, which would be "Racemenu" which could be 
exchanged for "ECE" (which I didn't use since how I understand the general consens it is the less popular/used character editor)
and the other one would be "ASLAL" which is included since it is again general consens, that it
is a better to have an AS Mods that places you in a "quiet" game cell to let all the installed mods finish their 
initial loading and giving you the time to set up the installed mods MCM Menus to your liking. 
And I chose "ASLAL" over other "AS" simce it still allows you/players playing your modlist(based on this resource)
a chance to experience the Vanilla start to the game.
**Therefore feel free to use this as a basis for your modlists(but if you do so please mention it somewhere visible).**


If you haven't modded before or without any method behind it or you can't make anything of the acronyms used in the section above would
I highly advise you to use one of the other great and feature rich Modlists availabe for Wabbajack if you want more than a basic vanilla 
experience ofn the game, but if you want something personalized for you you should follow this well produced **Tutorial Playlists**
(by Michael (Running the GamerPoets YT Channel:https://www.youtube.com/user/gamerpoets/about)) 
and learn how to do it yourself to better understand
why and how you are using certain (with this List preconfigured) Tools:

Now you should have the basic setup to start modding, and when doing so always check the description of the mod you are trying to install
to check for incompatibilities and/or changes to the standard installation procedure. 

**!AND ALWAYS CHECK FOR THE COMPATIBILTY WITH YOUR GAME AND SKSE64 VERSIONS!**

**(When modding on your own.)**

### 2. INSTALLATION

0. Put the Content of "Game Folder Files" into your Game Folder.
1. Locate the BethINI.exe in "...\(name of the MO 2 folder)\tools\BethINI (ONLY LAUNCH WITH MO CLOSED)" and run it with the game and MO2 closed.
2. In there go to the Setup tab and point BethINI to your ModOrganizer.EXE.
3. Select the SME(FT) Profile
4. Now you Select a Preset fitting your Hardware/Plans of adding an ENB
5. Save and Exit
6. Either run the FNIS tool or disable "Fores New Idles in Skyrim SE - FNIS SE", "FNIS Spells SE", "FNIS Creature Pack SE" and "FNIS Output"
~~7. If you plan on using DynDOLOD you need to download and install a Billboard mod fitting for your modlists set of weather mods yourself.~~
7. Due to it being hosted on the LE Nexus and it is way harder to track updates as an SE user I dropped DynDOLOD from the list.
8. All the other tools are added for your convinience but don't require an additional setup, if you don't plan on using them.
9. To Launch the game select SKSE in MO2 and hit launch, there you can also create MO2 shortcuts to automatically launch linked binaries trough MO2.
10. Your MO2 Setup is now ready to start modding/ playing the most barebone PC friendly Skyrim experience.

### 3. Included Patches

If a mod I used has patches for other mods they are included but need to be enabled by you they are marked with a sperator 
and each one of them has the mods the patch is for included in its name and/or a note inside of MO.
