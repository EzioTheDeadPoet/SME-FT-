### 1. GENERAL-DESCRIPTION

#### What is this list trying to offer ?

This modlist aims to be a resource for modders with at least enough of an experience in skyrim modding in general, to be able to 
trouble shoot their own modlists mith the documentation provided for the mods in their descriptions, preexisting guides on the
matter of modding and the tools provided by the modding community and their documentations.
Or people who just want a vanilla experience with all the unofficial patches and fixes.
One resource I highly recommend is [this Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/wiki/begin2) on how to get started.

This resoucre is intended to bring the most common tools and fixes for skyrim and integrate them in an Organized maner so modlist creators
and modders have an easier way of getting a stable initial semivanilla setup with only a little effort.
Some of the mods might want to be exchanged by personal preference, which would be "Racemenu" which could be 
exchanged for "ECE" (which I didn't use since how I understand the general consens it is the less popular/used character editor)
and the other one would be "ASLAL" which is included since it is again general consens, that it
is a better to have an AS Mods that places you in a "quiet" game cell to let all the installed mods finish their 
initial loading and giving you the time to set up the installed mods MCM Menus to your liking. 
And I chose "ASLAL" over another "AS" since it still allows you/players playing your modlist
a chance to experience the Vanilla start to the game.
**Therefore feel free to use this as a basis for your modlists(but if you do so please mention it somewhere visible).**

### 3. Included Patches

If a mod I used has patches for other mods they are included but need to be enabled by you they are marked 
by being the only mods enabled in the `SME(FT) - Optional Downloads` Profile and are art of the patch mod category of MO. 
Each one of them has the mods the patch is for included in its name and/or a note inside of MO.
